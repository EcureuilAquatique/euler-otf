This is an experimental Unicode complaint, OpenType enriched math font
based on Type1 version of AMS Euler.

This font is based on version 3 of AMS Euler, which have been refined
by Taco Hoekwater after being reviewed by Hermann Zapf.

The aim is to combine the 19 Type1 font files into single OpenType font,
supplement its missing math symbols from Computer Modern math fonts,
map the glyphs to Unicode Math code points and enrich the font with
OpenType layout data, especially MATH table.

The font is in beta stage, but it is usable, though more fine tuning
still missing.
