This is an experimental Unicode complaint, OpenType enriched math font
based on Type1 version of AMS Euler.

The aim is to combine the 19 Type1 font files into single OpenType font,
supplement its missing math symbols from Computer Modern math fonts,
map the glyphs to Unicode Math code points and enrich the font with
OpenType layout data, especially MATH table.

It is in a very early state, not even beta quality yet.

I'm doing this mainly as an exercise of OpenType MATH table and Latin
based mathematical typesetting in general, I rarely do non-Arabic
math myself.
