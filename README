Our goal is to create an OpenType MATH-enabled font euler.otf, by
combining the existing Euler math fonts with new glyphs from Hermann
Zapf and adding MATH table information.

The MATH table work is almost done, and initial glyph review by Zapf
have been conducted and implemented, we are planning for another review
before the first official beta.
